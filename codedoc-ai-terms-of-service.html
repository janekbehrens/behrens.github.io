    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      By installing or using CodeDoc AI for Confluence ("the App"), you agree to these
      Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.
      These Terms apply in addition to the
      <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/legal/software-license-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian Customer Agreement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of the App</h2>
    <p>CodeDoc AI is a Confluence Cloud app that generates documentation from source code repositories using AI. The App provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration with Git hosting providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) to read source code.</li>
      <li>Integration with AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI) to generate documentation.</li>
      <li>Automated publishing of generated documentation as Confluence pages.</li>
      <li>Manual, webhook-based, and scheduled trigger mechanisms for documentation generation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)</h2>
    <p>
      The App requires you to provide your own API keys and access tokens for all third-party
      services (AI providers and Git providers). <strong>You are solely responsible for:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obtaining, managing, and securing your API keys and access tokens.</li>
      <li>All costs incurred with your AI provider (token usage fees) and Git provider.</li>
      <li>Compliance with the terms of service of your chosen AI and Git providers.</li>
      <li>Ensuring your API keys have appropriate permissions and are not shared with unauthorized parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not provide, manage, or subsidize API keys. The App has no access to your keys beyond
      what is stored in your Confluence instance's encrypted Forge storage.
    </p>

    <h2>4. License</h2>
    <p>
      Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
      to use the App on your Atlassian Confluence Cloud instance in accordance with your Atlassian
      Marketplace subscription (free or paid plan).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App only for its intended purpose within Confluence Cloud.</li>
      <li>Not reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
      <li>Not use the App to process code or generate content that violates applicable laws, your AI provider's acceptable use policy, or Atlassian's terms.</li>
      <li>Not use the App in any way that could harm, disable, or impair the Atlassian platform or other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p class="legal-caps">
      The documentation generated by the App is produced by third-party AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI,
      or Google AI) and is <strong>not reviewed, verified, or endorsed by us</strong>. AI-generated
      content may contain inaccuracies, errors, omissions, or outdated information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>You are solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all generated
      documentation before publishing or relying on it.</strong> We accept no liability for the
      accuracy, completeness, or suitability of AI-generated content.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App integrates with third-party services that are not operated or controlled by us:

      App's functionality. Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Source Code Transmission</h2>
